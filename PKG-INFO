Description: Introduction
        ============

        Integrates collective.blogging into Collage.

        Installation
        ============

        * Add ``collective.collage.blogging`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::

        [buildout]
        ...
        eggs =
        ...
        collective.collage.blogging

        * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::

        [instance]
        recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
        ...
        zcml =
        collective.collage.blogging

        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with::

        $ ./bin/buildout

        You can skip the ZCML slug if you are using Plone 3.3 or if you are going to explicitly include
        the package from another package's configure.zcml file.
